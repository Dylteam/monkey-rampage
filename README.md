## ❓ Trademark FAQ

**Q: Is Monkey Rampage™ a registered trademark?**  
A: No — Monkey Rampage™ is currently an unregistered trademark. The **™** symbol indicates we are claiming trademark rights in the name, but it has not been officially registered with any government agency.

**Q: Can you use ™ without registration?**  
A: Yes. The **™** symbol can be used by anyone to show they consider a name or logo their brand, even without official registration. It helps notify others that the name is claimed.

**Q: What are the benefits of registering a trademark?**  
A: Official registration provides stronger legal protection, broader/registered territorial rights (e.g., nationwide in the U.S.), and easier enforcement against infringement. Registration costs money and takes time.

**Q: Do I have to register to use the ™ symbol?**  
A: No. You can use **™** as soon as you start using a name or logo in commerce or public promotion. Registration is optional but recommended if you want maximum legal protection.

**Q: How can you prove ownership without registration?**  
A: Public records (this GitHub page), dated social media posts, store pages, and archived snapshots help establish “first use” and support your claim.

**Q: Will you register the trademark later?**  
A: Possibly. We may consider official registration if Monkey Rampage™ grows and needs stronger protection.
